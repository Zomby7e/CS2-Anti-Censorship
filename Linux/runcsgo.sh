FAQ

    Q: Why the "w" or "p" command of this tool does not work?
    A: The game parameters set by the Steam client are still valid, you need to delete them.

    Q: Why is there a countdown after starting the Perfect World version?
    A: After about 20 seconds, the game will start completely. Restore the original names of all files so that it does not cause game update errors.

What I want to say

    1.This tool was written for mainland Chinese:
    "Perfect World" uses several patch files (vpk files) in the game to make the game comply with the cultural review of the Chinese mainland government. Simply renaming them will invalidate them, but after the game is updated, the game will have serious bugs.
    If you use this tool to start Perfect World CS:GO, this tool invalidates the "Black Blood" patch, starts the game, and restores the patch after the 20 second countdown.

    2.You may need to change the configureFile() function and the PATH_CSGO variable.

    3.`echo "Good luck and have fun, ${USER}!"`
